# ClassExtractor

**ClassExtractor** is a Visual Studio Code extension that helps front-end developers quickly extract unique CSS class names from selected HTML, JSX, or Shopify Liquid code and copy them to the clipboard — ready to use in your stylesheets or utility-first frameworks like Tailwind CSS.
Here’s an improved and more polished version of your **Usage** section, keeping it clear, professional, and user-friendly:

## 🛠️ Usage

To extract CSS class names:

1. **Select** the portion of code containing your HTML, JSX, Liquid, etc.
2. **Right-click** and choose **"Extract Classes"**,
   _or_ use the keyboard shortcut:
   **`Ctrl + Alt + E`** (Windows/Linux)
   **`Cmd + Option + E`** (Mac)

Once triggered, ClassExtractor will extract, clean, and copy the class names to your clipboard — ready to paste into your CSS or utility framework.
